HousePricing_Kaggle: small machine-learning project based on Kaggle dataset of house prices in Ames, Iowa.

MNIST_DigitClassifier: machine-learning project based on MNIST image dataset, which contains 60,000 28x28 black and white images of digits (0-9) in the training set and
10,000 28x28 black and white images of digits (0-9) in the test set. Data was downloaded from Kaggle (since it was in an easy-to-read CSV format already). Added mutli-digit recognition as of 12/28/2020 (i.e. numbers > 9 can be identified).
