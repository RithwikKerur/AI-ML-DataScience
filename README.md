# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects
Data Science &amp; ML projects written in Python in Jupyter Notebooks. 

HousePricing_Kaggle: small machine-learning project based on Kaggle dataset of house prices in Ames, Iowa. Achieves roughly a $16000 RMSE, evaluating to about 90% accuracy, on test data, which is quite accurate.

MNIST_DigitClassifier: machine-learning project based on MNIST image dataset, which contains 60,000 28x28 black and white images of digits (0-9) in the training set and
10,000 28x28 black and white images of digits (0-9) in the test set. Data was downloaded from Kaggle (since it was in an easy-to-read CSV format already). Added mutli-digit recognition as of 12/28/2020 (i.e. numbers > 9 can be identified).

Titanic_DeathClassifier: machine-learning project based on Kaggle dataset of Titanic Deaths. Predicts whether a specific passenger died or survived on the Titanic based on several features (Age, Sex, Class, Fare, etc). Achieves a 81% cross validation accuracy score and a 76.7% test set accuracy score (after submitting it to the Kaggle competition).
